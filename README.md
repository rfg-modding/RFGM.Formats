# Rfg.Formats
Shared repo with code for reading and writing file formats used by the Red Faction Guerrilla. The packfile and PEG code is from [SyncFaction](https://github.com/rfg-modding/SyncFaction). The code from [RfgTools](https://github.com/rfg-modding/RfgTools) will eventually be ported to this too.
